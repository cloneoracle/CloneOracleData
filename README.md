CloneOracleData


This project contains Code Clone Oracle Data. Several open source applications were analyzed as part of this study including Apache, Python and PostgreSQL. There are two main sets of information:


A) CloneResults
- This folder contains the methods which were deemed to be clones by manual analysis, and through the use of various existing clone detection tools include Simian, Nicad, MeCC and CCCD. 
- The data is made available in several formats including html, xls and csv.


B) sourcecode
- This is the raw source code analyzed from Apache, Python and PostgreSQL. Due to the magnitude of these applications and the large amount of raw effort required to discover clones, only a small subset of each application was analyzed.
